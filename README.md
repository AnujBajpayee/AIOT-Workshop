# Sessions to be conducted  : 

- Session 1:
Introduction to Arduino and pointing out it's similarities with C,
By the end of this session participants shall build their first IoT project
using HCSR04 sensor and a buzzer/LED.

- Session 2:
making use of motor driver(mostly L298N) and HCSR04 sensor to make
a simple obstacle avoidance robot(using arduino uno/nano).

- Session 3:
 using blynk to make a home automation project, adding voice recognition(using IFTTT).

- Session 4:
making a wireless robot with esp32 (cam module)
,making use of its camera mode as well. (using esp as a local webserver)

- Session 5:
Adding Computer vision to previously built robots.
Like Object detection and tracking.(these projects are posted on our handle, we'll use beginner-friendly version of them)

- Session 6:
Using ML algorithms in projects. Make a IoT project-> collect sensor data-> fit in a ML alg.
(done)

- Session 7:
making CamVisioTech Mk1 (a beginner friendly version), i.e an esp32 cam based security system.

- Session 8:
Itâ€™ll be an assignment to make something using the curriculum taught throughout these weeks.
