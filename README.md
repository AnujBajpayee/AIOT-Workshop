# Sessions to be conducted  : 
We'll be integrating sessions the new session timeline is as follows:
1. Using HCSR04 and buzzer with Arduino along and connecting with IoT cloud services like blynk/adafruit.
2. Using Arduino and HCSR04 to build an obstacle avoiding robot + swapping it with Esp32cam for making a cam bot. 
3. Intro to ML - types, IoT use cases, fitting a simple model on any sensor data. What is ANN, CNN? 
4. What is ANN, CNN? --continued Making an object detection bot for surveillance + mediapipe hand tracking.
5. Haar Cascades who? Making CamVisioTech Mk1.
6. Assignment session.
